# Hi Everyone! 👋 I'm Kyungseok(Matthew) Lee.

I'm a **Mechanical Engineering** student at **Hanyang University** who loves to build things from scratch.

By day, I'm an engineer-in-training, learning the principles of how the world works. By night, I'm a **CEO and Founder**, turning bold ideas into real-world businesses. I've led teams, built products from 0-to-1, and secured ₩55M in funding, all driven by a relentless 'Grit' and a passion for problem-solving.

My journey is now converging on a singular mission: to merge the physical (Mechanics) and the digital (AI) worlds. I'm pivoting my 'Founder's mindset' to become a researcher in **HCI, Computer Vision, and Robotics**.

## 🛠️ I'm a Full-stack Maker

I thrive on bridging the entire creation process, from a rough idea to a physical, working prototype.

* **Software:** `Python` `AI/ML` `Computer Vision` `Development`
* **Hardware:** `Robotics (ROS2)` `Circuitry` `Hardware Prototyping`
* **Fabrication:** `3D Printing` `CAD/CAM` `3D Modeling`
* **Interaction:** `HCI` `Virtual Reality (VR)`

## 🌱 What I'm Up To

* `🔭` **I’m currently working on...**
    1.  **[Proof #1]** Building a **ROS2-based Autonomous Vehicle** from the ground up. (Completing the S/W)
    2.  **[Proof #2]** Planning my next project: using CV to turn my robot's camera into an 'eye' that can scan and map a room, inspired by the 'ParaHome' paper.

* `🌱` **I’m currently learning...**
    * **Pytorch** (The '60 Minute Blitz' official tutorial)
    * **Computer Vision** (Stanford's CS231n 2025 Spring course)
    * **Algorithms & Data Structures** ('이것이 코딩 테스트다')

* `👯` **I’m looking to collaborate on...**
    * Exciting projects involving **HCI, Robotics, VR/AR, or CV**. If you're building something cool, I'd love to hear about it!

* `💬` **Ask me about...**
    * **Entrepreneurship** (especially 0-to-1), pivoting, and problem-solving.
    * **3D Printing** and rapid hardware prototyping.
    * My 'Optimal Realism' (진인사대천명) philosophy.

* `📫` **How to reach me:**
    * `bu5119@hanyang.ac.kr`
    * [LinkedIn Profile (링크 추가)]

* `⚡` **Fun fact:**
    * I'm fascinated by '이세계' (Isekai) and '초능력' (Superpowers). My ultimate goal is to build the technology that makes those sci-fi concepts a reality.
